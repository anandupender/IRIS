        <h1>Examining the Influence of Solar Panel Installers on Design Innovation and Market Penetration</h1>
        <br/><br/>
        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>This work uses an agent-based model to examine how installers of photovoltaic (PV) panels influence panel design and the success of residential solar energy. It provides a novel approach to modeling intermediary stakeholder influence on product design, focusing on installer decisions instead of the typical foci of the final customer (homeowners) and the designer/manufacturer. Installers restrict homeowner choice to a subset of all panel options available, and, consequentially, determine medium-term market dynamics in terms of quantity and design specifications of panel installations. This model investigates installer profit-maximization strategies of exploring new panel designs offered by manufacturers (a risk-seeking strategy) vs. exploiting market-tested technology (a risk-averse strategy). Manufacturer design decisions and homeowner purchase decisions are modeled. Realistic details provided from installer and homeowner interviews are included. For example, installers must estimate panel reliability instead of trusting manufacturer statistics, and homeowners make purchase decisions based in part on installer reputation.  We find that installers pursue new and more-efficient panels over sticking-with market-tested technology under a variety of panel-reliability scenarios and two different state scenarios (California and Massachusetts). Results indicate that it does not matter if installers are predisposed to an exploration or exploitation strategy—both types choose to explore new panels that have higher efficiency.</p>

        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p>The matrix in Figure 9 summarizes, in qualitative form, the sensitivity analysis results of the model. In the matrix, all factors that influence the current penetration level ("immediate characteristics") or expected future sales belong to a few categories: physical characteristics (including design characteristics), market characteristics, and preferences characteristics. All factors were evaluated in terms of changes of total penetration levels with respect to the baseline scenario for California. Sensitivity in the table below provided the data for the summary Figure 9.
        We also find that roof size introduces restrictions on the possible system size and, as such, the potential market size. Interviews with installers support this finding. Installers stated that the physical properties of roofs contribute directly to the estimated installation price. Future improvements in panel efficiency will partially mitigate the roof-size effect. Also, exogenous changes in the level of solar irradiation, as exhibited in the CA vs. MA scenarios, alter the realized market price per watt. In both scenarios, the tendency to follow exploration strategy dominates.
        <br/><br/>As for market characteristics, the potential market size determines the financial viability of any strategy and thus is important to the decision-making agents. However, costs (hard and soft) are more important factors since they directly decide the expenses and determine the profitability of the systems and at what price point. Costs, representing the economics of currently-available panels, are particularly important in the analyzed scenarios. This conclusion is supported, for example, by the NREL report by Fu et al. [45], who analyzed installation dynamics and PV systems. The efficiency levels of PV panels directly influence the attainable hard costs levels. This finding explains why installers track efficiency levels so closely.
        Other factors might influence the choices that installers make on the PV market. For example, shocks to government policy might shift demand curves and result in temporary out-of-stock events. Testing those scenarios is possible with the current model but is outside the scope of the work.
        <br/><br/>A possible limitation of the qualitative conclusions is that we fixed the electricity price instead of it fluctuating over time. If the price of electricity increased, the adoption rate may have increased. However, allowing too many parameters to vary makes it more difficult to understand the reasons for the output; thus, this potential variable was held fixed.
        Also important are the model's assumptions about the preferences of installers (exploration vs. exploitation) and homeowners (rates of return on investment). Future work will explore more sophisticated models, including expanding homeowners’ decision choices to include design parameters of the PV system. We will use survey data, specifically choice-based-conjoint models built from surveys, to articulate homeowner preferences. We also plan to include in future models representations of government and utility decisions. Additionally, this paper does not explore different purchase models, such as leasing. Researchers could adapt the current model to address this. We do not discuss home renters in this study, as a typical home rental lease agreement forbids the modification of or addition to the house structure, nor do renters carry the proper insurance to permit installation. Renters could be modeled as an influencer on a homeowner's decision.
        <br/><br/>As the model cycles to maturity, the dynamics of the balance between exploration and exploitation change, and the reliability is weighted more heavily by homeowners. Another factor that continues to shape these dynamics is low-price, low-quality competition from manufacturers that specialize in such systems. The reason why efficiency is the dominant factor in decision-making is because of our model assumptions and because of the existing cost and information structure of the market. The research into residential solar PV owners by Rai et al. [49] supports some of these conclusions. Rai et al. found that financial considerations are important for solar adopters. But other results, such as how specific installers make their decisions and what their overall role is, are open questions for further investigation by researchers.
        <br/><br/>Our assumptions and generalizations do impose limitations on the implications of the work. These limitations include not explicitly modeling manufacturers' research priorities. Explicit modeling of these might change the unanimous dominance of efficiency as the major deciding factor for installers. The restrictions on choice also limit our conclusions. For example, installers can only consider one manufacturer each cycle, and homeowners can only consider one installer, who offers only one panel type, each cycle. These choice restrictions provide clarity on the agent-based model conclusions, without too many "moving parts," but it is difficult to perform basic validation of the results and explore high-level trends, as presented here.
        <br/><br/>Another potential issue lies with imposing specific functional forms on the reliability and complexity distributions. While our assumptions are conservative, it could be argued that we should investigate other possible approaches. We have not been able to find comparable research papers to provide the comparative analysis. There are also limitations on the installer when choosing potential PV panels for new proposals or considering only the profit as the goal. But it is unclear if more explicit modeling of this procedure would alter the results, while the level of model complexity would significantly increase. Our model does not include government and utility permitting processes, but they will be added in future work. Properly addressing some problems, such as changes in the PV industry standards at the state and county level, requires changing the focus of the model and is therefore outside of the scope of the work.
        <br/><br/>To summarize, the analysis investigated the dynamics of PV system penetration in the U.S. residential solar energy market using an agent-based model. In particular, we focused on an intermediary agent, installers; this was articulated in the model as guiding design developments of PV panels. The more traditional approach is to directly model homeowners as guiding these developments through their preferences/choices. The model articulated the installers' decision process as one of exploration vs. exploitation, while maximizing profits. Whether the exploration or the exploitation technology adoption strategy dominates depends on the specifics of the market, such as effect of reputation, which was possibly under-represented in the model.
        As represented, the installers explore new panel offers more than they exploit existing panels, and this drives technological development (panel efficiency). This result has potential implications for policy-makers at the state and national level; if policies can alleviate risks from new panel technologies, perhaps by financially compensating homeowners for system downtime, efficiency should be highly-sought over reliability, which would be a boon to the progress of the solar industry.</p>
