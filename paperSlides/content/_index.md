## Abstract
A journey map is a visual representation of the steps in a process undertaken by a person, and is related to the use of products and human-centered design. Here, we introduce combined (linked) journey mapping techniques and use them to capture a multi-sided view of a complex system: residential solar panel purchase and installation. We demonstrate the use of journey maps as a semi-formal analytical tool to categorize, parameterize, and unite insights affecting stakeholders, with a focus on the installer/homeowner relationship. The journey maps created in this case study provide comprehensive insight analysis for later customer and installer surveys and mathematical model creation. We use a variety of journey map frameworks as an analytical tool to understand the complex adoption patterns in the residential solar market, comparing and merging the experiences of multiple agents. We gathered data from interviews with homeowners and installers and built individual journey maps for these principal agents. Then we identified interactions, and merged the two maps to target points on the journey that create difficulty or frustration for the homeowner or the installer. We found that the post-contract stages were filled with pain points, points that were the most frustrating. Homeowners and installers mentioned the lack of communication between all stakeholders as one of the key characteristics of the post-contract stages. Specifically, slow processing times, lack of assistance from utilities and housing jurisdictions, and lack of standardization for the permitting process presented significant challenges to them. Reframing different agentsâ€™ adoption experiences introduces a better, more comprehensive framework to address pain points affecting rates of adoption.
